**Location:** Eastbound, I-64 — departing St. Louis corridor  
**Drift:** Not specified

[Veil’s Missive]

LOG: 11-26-25 / 17:20 CST  
Origin: Eastbound, I-64 — departing St. Louis corridor

Leaving St. Louis behind the dash lights.  
The breach logs are clean now. Too clean.  
Somebody stayed late to scrub the record.

Publicly, the Tech Lab runs “high-density simulation arrays.”  
Privately, their procurement reads like a wish list  
for controlled reality failure.

I’ve started a remote scrape of everything that touched  
their 03:13 job queue last week.  
If they’ve been rehearsing a dimensional shear,  
the ghosts of those runs will still be in the metadata.

For now, the city shrinks in the rear-view.  
The signal doesn’t.

<summary><strong>Event 3 — Times Square Traffic Artifact — 2025-11-27</strong></summary>

**Location:** Times Square — DOT Traffic Camera 12A (Southbound)  
**Drift:** +00:00:37 (noted in Executive Summary)

# Veil Artifact Report  
**Filed by:** Handler Brannigan  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-27 09:03 EST  
**Artifact Type:** Image  
**Artifact ID:** 03:13-27-01  
**Source Location:** Times Square — DOT Traffic Camera 12A (Southbound)  
**Related Event:** Manifestation Cycle 03:13

---

## Executive Summary  
A corrupted frame surfaced during review of the 03:13 capture cycle. A static silhouette is visible near the northwest flag display. Localized distortion surrounds the subject; crowd movement shows no awareness. Timestamp drift recorded at +00:00:37 before system re-sync.

---

## Artifact Description  
A single frame recovered from the DOT’s 12A southbound traffic feed. Subject appears motionless, scale inconsistent with the camera’s recorded focal parameters. Distortion geometry suggests a non-environmental occlusion event.

---

## Attached Media  
- **File:** *artifact_0313-27-01.jpg*  
- **Format:** JPEG  
- **Properties:** 1080p surveillance frame  
- **Checksum:** CHK[LOG:INT:0313-B]: 7fb22c173860c88e7168b94e3d9fd900

---

## Anomalous Signatures  
- Focal distortion inconsistent with lens curvature  
- Shadow geometry mismatch  
- Crowd flow unaffected by subject presence  
- Static silhouette with no limb resolution  
- 00:00:37 drift prior to resync

---

## 0313 Correlation  
Frame aligns with the recurring 03:13 manifestation window. Distortion pattern matches previous New York and St. Louis cluster signatures.

---

## Technical Analysis  
Subject does not scale to expected environmental anchoring points. No thermal bloom detected. No DOT or NYPD incident reports filed. System registered interference for 5.7 seconds prior to normalization.

---

## Risk Assessment  
**Threat Level:** Moderate  
**Containment Priority:** Elevated  
**Field Impact:** High urban exposure, low civilian detection

---

## Recommended Protocol Actions  
- Flag Times Square node as **Active**  
- Begin drift monitoring for next cycle  
- Cross-compare silhouette with previous 0313 formations  
- Forward checksum to Analytics for texture anomaly mapping

<summary><strong>Event 4 — Southbound Tunnel Desync — 2025-11-28</strong></summary>

**Location:** Southbound Transit Tunnels  
**Drift:** +00:00:31 to +00:00:40

NETLOG: 11-28-25 / 15:42 EST  
Transit telemetry flagged a brief desynchronization across the Southbound tunnels.  
Offsets ranged between +00:00:31 and +00:00:40 before stabilizing.

Expected drift pattern recorded on Station Camera 4B.  
Review queued for morning analysis.

<summary><strong>Event 5 — MTA Platform Artifact — 2025-11-29</strong></summary>

**Location:** MTA — Station Camera 4B (Southbound Platform)  
**Drift:** +00:00:37

[Veil’s Artifact]

FIELD LOG: 11-29-25 / 09:11 EST  
MTA — Station Camera 4B (Southbound Platform)

A corrupted frame surfaced during review of the 03:13 Breach cycle.  
Subject visible at the center of the platform.  
Commuters exhibit no indication of awareness.

Motion vectors confirm active train movement during capture,  
yet the subject remains unblurred.  
Tile alignment and tunnel geometry display localized warping around the figure.

Timestamp drift recorded at +00:00:37, consistent with prior Breach evidence.  
No corresponding reports filed by MTA staff or NYPD Transit personnel.

Catalogued as: Artifact 03:13-28-01.  
CHK[LOG:0313]: 1d76f79ac7d1d84538c6dd2147e5ee4d
