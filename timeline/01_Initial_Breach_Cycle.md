# Initial Breach Cycle Timeline

Documenting confirmed breach events beginning November 22, 2025.  
All timestamps reflect the recording device’s local time unless noted.  
Drift is recorded as the deviation between device timestamp and system clock.

## Event One — Initial Modern Manifestation  
**Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Local Time:** 03:13:00 (approx.)  
**Location:** Undisclosed research corridor  
**Artifact:** None recovered  
**Drift:** +00:00:37 (resolved)

**Description:**  
The earliest verified breach of this cycle.  
A corridor monitoring device recorded abrupt chromatic bending, environmental warping, and momentary depth collapse.  
A partial silhouette manifested for less than a second before stabilization.  
Personnel on site reported no visual anomalies in real time.

**Associated Distortions:**  
- Corridor warping  
- Temporal desync  
- Single-frame optical distortion  
- Early-stage silhouette imprint

**Classification:** Initial Manifestation Indicators

## Event Two — Tech Lab Breach  
**Date:** 2025-11-23  
**Local Time:** 03:13:04  
**Location:** High-Tech R&D Laboratory  
**Camera:** Multiple feeds  
**Drift:** +00:00:37  
**Artifact:** Internal frames corrupted; partial captures only

**Description:**  
Two independent silhouettes registered across separate angles.  
One formed as a wall-shadow extrusion; the second entered partial frame under heavy glitch load.  
Four seconds after initial desync, feeds collapsed into black static.

**Associated Distortions:**  
- Multi-feed desynchronization  
- Shadow extrusion not matching geometry  
- Severe glitch tearing  
- Full-frame corruption

**Classification:** Early Double-Vector Manifestation

## Event Three — DOT and Transit System Anomalies  
**Date:** 2025-11-24  
**Local Time:** 03:13:37  
**Location:** Citywide DOT and Subway Infrastructure  
**Artifact:** Multi-camera recordings (partial)  
**Drift:** +00:00:37 (unresolved)

**Description:**  
Transportation cameras across the network registered simultaneous minor distortions.  
Motion blur failed to align with light sources, indicating temporal shear.  
A one-second audio dropout across unrelated systems matched the 0-3-1-3 signature.

**Associated Distortions:**  
- Synchronization failures  
- Motion-light mismatch  
- Mass audio dropout  
- Early echo-static patterning

**Classification:** Distributed Minor Breach Event

## Event Four — Nightclub / Indoor Venue Disturbance  
**Date:** 2025-11-25  
**Local Time:** 02:50–03:20 (multiple captures)  
**Location:** Nightlife venue, downtown  
**Camera:** Interior feeds  
**Drift:** Intermittent

**Description:**  
Vespera appeared in peripheral regions of multiple feeds despite patrons reporting no abnormalities.  
Lighting collapsed depth in several shots, particularly near reflective surfaces such as mirrors and glass.

**Associated Distortions:**  
- Peripheral figure tracking  
- Depth loss  
- Reflective-surface collapse  
- Intermittent chromatic displacement

**Classification:** Mid-Intensity Peripheral Manifestation

## Event Five — Precursor Corridor Distortion  
**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Local Time:** ~02:10 CST (est.)  
**Location:** St. Louis, Midtown Office Corridor  
**Drift:** +00:00:37  
**Artifact:** None preserved beyond environmental logs

**Description:**  
Environmental sensors registered corridor deformation prior to the primary event.  
Spatial compression along the right corridor wall persisted for several minutes.  
This precursor distortion aligns with known signs of imminent manifestation.

**Associated Distortions:**  
- Sustained spatial compression  
- Corridor geometry deviation  
- Unresolved drift  
- Light source misalignment

**Classification:** Pre-Manifestation Corridor Deformation

## Event Six — St. Louis Corridor Breach (CAM-04 NORTH)  
**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Local Time:** 02:13:37 CST  
**Location:** Midtown Office Corridor, St. Louis, MO  
**Camera:** CAM-04 NORTH  
**Artifact:** 0313-STL-01  
**Drift:** +00:00:37 (unresolved)

**Description:**  
A corrupted frame was recovered during post-incident indexing from CAM-04 NORTH.  
A silhouette is visible at the far end of the corridor.  
Spatial compression is evident along the east-facing wall, with overhead light bending toward the central figure.  
Environmental blur is present; the subject remains stable in-frame.  
No personnel on shift reported visual anomalies at the recorded time.

**Associated Distortions:**  
- Spatiotemporal compression  
- Chromatic fringing around silhouette  
- Timestamp drift  
- Partial frame corruption  
- Asymmetric blur field

**Classification:** Early Post-Manifestation Residue
