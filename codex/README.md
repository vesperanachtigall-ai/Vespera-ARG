# Vespera Master Codex Overview

This folder contains the complete Vespera Master Codex, which defines all core rules and world logic of the ARG. The Codex is the authoritative document for themes, behavior, lore, physics, tone, and escalation systems.

Only one file is used for the Codex:  
Vespera_Master_Codex.md

It includes three major sections:
- Core Foundations  
- Addendum with advanced systems and deep lore  
- Hybrid ARG Engine for seasonal and long term structure  

Use this document when creating or verifying any new content, including:
- Artifact descriptions  
- Veil missives  
- Timeline entries  
- Engine updates  
- Character interactions  
- Visual and audio assets  

### How to Update the Codex

Edits to the Codex should follow these rules:

1. All new information must be consistent with existing sections unless a later season intentionally revises canon.
2. Any new rule or lore addition must state clearly which section it belongs to.
3. Major structural changes should be noted in commit messages.
4. Tone, physics, and narrative rules must remain aligned with the rest of the repository.
5. The Codex should never contradict itself. If a contradiction is found, resolve it with an addendum note rather than altering past canon without record.

### When to Update the Codex

Update the Codex when:
- A new season begins.
- A new type of breach is introduced.
- A new entity is added to the lore.
- Visual or audio language expands.
- The Veil changes due to succession events.
- Annual escalation on March thirteen modifies rules for the next cycle.

### Navigation

To use the Codex effectively:
- Refer to the foundations section when establishing tone or character behavior.
- Refer to the addendum section when generating artifacts or multi medium events.
- Refer to the engine section when planning season wide arcs or long form structure.
- Link relevant Codex rules from timeline entries when documenting anomalies.

The Codex exists to ensure that the world remains internally consistent as the ARG grows over years of development.

### Contact

For any structural changes or expansions to the Codex, ensure notes are added either in this folder or through commit messages so long term continuity remains intact.
