# Vespera ARG — Core Repository

Central repository for the Vespera Alternate Reality Game (ARG).  
This project contains the Master Codex, breach physics, visual and audio language bibles, continuity rules, and the long-form narrative framework governing the 03:13 timeline.

# Master Codex

The **Vespera Master Codex** combines all three foundational documents into a single, unified reference:

**`codex/Vespera_Master_Codex.md`**  
https://github.com/vesperanachtigall-ai/Vespera-ARG/blob/main/codex/Vespera_Master_Codex.md

This codex contains:

- Core Foundations (Part 1)  
- Advanced Systems and Deep Lore (Addendum)  
- Hybrid ARG Engine and Multiyear Design (Part 3)  

It defines the canon rules for:

- Breach physics  
- Timeline structure  
- Character behavior  
- Tone and linguistic rules  
- Multi-platform continuity  
- Seasonal escalation  
- Veil succession  
- Long-form cosmology  

All ARG content must follow the Codex unless a future season intentionally revises canon.

# Engine Documents

The engine governs how the ARG behaves mechanically.  
These documents ensure the narrative and audiovisual rules remain consistent.

**`engine/0313_Event_Blueprint.md`**  
https://github.com/vesperanachtigall-ai/Vespera-ARG/blob/main/engine/0313_Event_Blueprint.md

Defines:
- Minor, Major, and Annual 03:13 breaches  
- Drift rules  
- Grid event behavior  
- Implementation notes for new anomalies  

**`engine/Season_Model.md`**  
https://github.com/vesperanachtigall-ai/Vespera-ARG/blob/main/engine/Season_Model.md

Defines:
- The Long Shadow  
- The Ascent  
- The Event Horizon  
- Engagement-responsive pacing  
- Multi-year sustainability

More engine files will be added as the ARG expands.

# Artifacts

The artifacts directory contains the media and documentation recovered from breach events. Each subfolder organizes a specific type of anomaly.

Artifacts are grouped as follows:

- images/  
  Contains still images, CCTV frames, composites, and breach photographs.

- video/  
  Contains video files including multi-feed grid events, handheld captures, and surveillance anomalies.

- audio/  
  Contains 0-3-1-3 pattern recordings, Temporal Elegy fragments, and other breach-related audio.

- transcripts/  
  Contains Veil missives, logs, dialogue transcriptions, and textual artifacts.

Each artifact should link to a corresponding timeline entry and maintain consistency with the visual and audio language defined in the Codex.


Artifacts represent the recovered media produced by breach events.  
Folders are structured as follows:

# Timeline

Timeline files document canonical breach events in chronological order.

**`timeline/01_Initial_Breach_Cycle.md`**  
https://github.com/vesperanachtigall-ai/Vespera-ARG/blob/main/timeline/01_Initial_Breach_Cycle.md

Each timeline entry includes:
- Timestamp (+00:00:37 drift when applicable)  
- Breach level  
- Distortion behaviors  
- Associated artifacts  
- Notes from the Veil  
- Lore significance  

New timeline files will be added as each season unfolds.

# Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `codex/`  
  - Contains the combined Vespera Master Codex (`Vespera_Master_Codex.md`).

- `engine/`  
  - `0313_Event_Blueprint.md` defines breach levels and 03:13 behavior.  
  - `Season_Model.md` defines seasonal and multi-year structure.

- `timeline/`  
  - `01_Initial_Breach_Cycle.md` documents the earliest canonical events.

- `artifacts/`  
  - `images/` for still-image artifacts.  
  - `video/` for video artifacts.  
  - `audio/` for sound artifacts and 0-3-1-3 captures.  
  - `transcripts/` for Veil logs, missives, and dialog.

- Root files:  
  - `README.md` (this file).  
  - `LICENSE` (project licensing terms).

# Contribution Guidelines

This repository serves as the authoritative reference for the Vespera ARG.

Contributions must:
- Follow breach physics  
- Respect Codex-defined behavior  
- Maintain tone (Veil: clinical; Vespera: Victorian contempt)  
- Avoid contradictions across media  
- Preserve the chronology of breach events  
- Support multi-year scalability  

Pull requests should describe which part of the canon they extend or refine.
