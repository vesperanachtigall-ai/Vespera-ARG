# Vespera ARG — Core Repository

Central repository for the Vespera Alternate Reality Game (ARG).  
This project contains the Master Codex, breach physics, visual and audio language bibles, continuity rules, and the long-form narrative framework governing the 03:13 timeline.

# Master Codex

The **Vespera Master Codex** combines all three foundational documents into a single, unified reference:

**`codex/Vespera_Master_Codex.md`**  
https://github.com/vesperanachtigall-ai/Vespera-ARG/blob/main/codex/Vespera_Master_Codex.md

This codex contains:

- Core Foundations (Part 1)  
- Advanced Systems and Deep Lore (Addendum)  
- Hybrid ARG Engine and Multiyear Design (Part 3)  

It defines the canon rules for:

- Breach physics  
- Timeline structure  
- Character behavior  
- Tone and linguistic rules  
- Multi-platform continuity  
- Seasonal escalation  
- Veil succession  
- Long-form cosmology  

All ARG content must follow the Codex unless a future season intentionally revises canon.

# Engine Documents

The engine governs how the ARG behaves mechanically.  
These documents ensure the narrative and audiovisual rules remain consistent.

**`engine/0313_Event_Blueprint.md`**  
https://github.com/vesperanachtigall-ai/Vespera-ARG/blob/main/engine/0313_Event_Blueprint.md

Defines:
- Minor, Major, and Annual 03:13 breaches  
- Drift rules  
- Grid event behavior  
- Implementation notes for new anomalies  

**`engine/Season_Model.md`**  
https://github.com/vesperanachtigall-ai/Vespera-ARG/blob/main/engine/Season_Model.md

Defines:
- The Long Shadow  
- The Ascent  
- The Event Horizon  
- Engagement-responsive pacing  
- Multi-year sustainability

More engine files will be added as the ARG expands.

# Artifacts

Artifacts represent the recovered media produced by breach events.  
Folders are structured as follows:
