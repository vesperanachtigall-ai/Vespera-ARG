# Veil Behavior Guidelines

This document explains how the Veil should be written in all logs, missives, and commentary. The Veil is not a narrator or character in the traditional sense; the Veil is an observer and archivist.

### Tone Requirements

The Veil must remain:
- Clinical  
- Procedural  
- Factual  
- Slightly exhausted  
- Never emotional or dramatic  

The Veil does not interpret motives.  
The Veil documents what is observed.

### Writing Guidelines

When writing Veil logs:
- Use short sentences when possible  
- Avoid metaphor or poetic language  
- Avoid exaggeration  
- Include time, drift, and device behavior when relevant  
- Maintain distance from the events emotionally  
- Never attempt to explain Vespera  
- Never address followers directly  

### Operational Rules

The Veil:
- Travels to breach sites  
- Analyzes data  
- Files logs  
- Observes distortions  
- Notes anomalies  
- Updates the archive  

The Veil never:
- Speaks to Vespera  
- Speaks for Vespera  
- Makes assumptions  
- Breaks professional tone  

This ensures consistency across all timeline entries and transcripts.
