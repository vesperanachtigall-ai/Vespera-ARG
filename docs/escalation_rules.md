# Escalation Rules

This document explains how escalation functions in the Vespera ARG. Escalation refers to the increase in intensity, frequency, or narrative weight of breach events as the story progresses.

Escalation must follow a predictable structure even when individual events vary.

### Core Escalation Levels

Minor events  
These occur regularly and show limited distortion. They are usually detected on surveillance systems.

Major events  
These happen less frequently and involve multi feed behavior, stronger distortion, and multiple anomalies in different mediums.

Annual escalation  
This is the major collapse event occurring each year during the month of March. It produces the most severe distortions and resets the season structure.

### Escalation Constraints

All escalation must:
- Respect the physics defined in the Codex  
- Build gradually over time  
- Avoid sudden jumps that contradict earlier patterns  
- Follow the structure described in the engine folder  

### Escalation Timing

Minor events may occur daily.  
Major events may occur monthly.  
Annual escalation occurs once per year on March thirteen.

These rules ensure the ARG remains predictable in structure while still allowing creative variation.
