# Artifact Handling

This document explains how to create, organize, and record artifacts. Artifacts include images, videos, audio files, transcripts, and any other media recovered from breach events.

### General Rules

All artifacts must:
- Connect to a timeline entry  
- Follow the distortion rules in the Codex  
- Be dated using year month day format  
- Include notes describing what was observed  
- Maintain visual and audio consistency  

### Image Guidelines

Image artifacts should show:
- Photorealistic Vespera  
- Cold Victorian lighting  
- Spatial compression  
- Chromatic bending  
- Motion blur on environment only  

### Video Guidelines

Video artifacts should:
- Follow the correct escalation pattern  
- Use drift where appropriate  
- Display multi feed timing errors when needed  

### Audio Guidelines

Audio artifacts should:
- Follow the zero three one three structure  
- Use detuned or corrupted motifs  
- Represent distortion accurately  

### Transcript Guidelines

Transcripts should:
- Follow Veil tone rules  
- Include event context  
- Avoid speculation  

Artifact handling ensures that the world remains consistent and believable.
