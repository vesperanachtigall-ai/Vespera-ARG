# 03:13 Event Blueprint

This document encodes how 03:13-related breaches behave across three levels:
minor breaches, major breaches, and the annual March 13 escalation event.

## 1. Breach Levels

### 1.1 Minor Breach — Daily 03:13 Events

Frequency:
- Daily or near-daily during active cycles (especially in early arcs).

Mediums:
- CCTV feeds
- Phone cameras
- Mirrors and reflective surfaces

Characteristics:
- Timestamp anchored to 03:13 with a +00:00:37 drift offset before stabilization.
- Vespera visible primarily to cameras, not humans.
- Chromatic aberration around her outline.
- She is photorealistic; the world around her may blur or smear.
- 0313 appears as an environmental artifact (clocks, monitors, file names), never as a foreground element.

Visual signatures:
- Subtle scanline tearing.
- Spatial compression near her (straight lines curve).
- Autofocus failure around her silhouette.

Audio signatures:
- Low-level 0-3-1-3 pattern in background hum or static.
- Brief detuned strings, clockwork clicks, or radio ticks.

### 1.2 Major Breach — Monthly Video Events

Frequency:
- Once per month, ideally the first Monday, aligned to 03:13 EST.

Mediums:
- Multi-feed CCTV grids (4x4, 2x4, etc.)
- Broadcast failures
- Security monitoring walls

Characteristics:
- Multiple camera feeds desynchronize (frame stutters, timestamp mismatch).
- Vespera may appear in multiple feeds simultaneously, often with slight timeline offsets.
- Some feeds drop in a 0-3-1-3 pattern (0 = blank, 3 = three feeds active, 1 = one feed with her present, 3 = three glitched feeds).

Visual signatures:
- Grid feeds flicker in 0313 patterns.
- Depth-map collapse (background “smear” while she remains crisp).
- Echo-Vespera frames (her in more than one place at once).

Audio signatures:
- Stronger 0-3-1-3 pattern:
  - 0: silence
  - 3: pulses
  - 1: rupture
  - 3: echoes or reversed decays

### 1.3 Escalation Event — Annual March 13 Collapse

Timestamp:
- Every year at 03:13 EST on 03/13.

Characteristics:
- Storm-class breach: visual, audio, temporal, spatial.
- Multi-feed grid (8-16 feeds):
  - Top row follows forward 0-3-1-3 pattern.
  - Bottom row follows reverse 3-1-3-0 pattern.
- Widespread 0313 propagation across all feeds.

Narrative beats:
1. Vespera issues a ritual statement.
2. The Veil posts a final yearly log after the event.
3. Breach radius peaks.
4. Canon rules for the next season shift.

## 2. Temporal Drift Rules

Core rule: +00:00:37 drift appears before breach stabilization.

Guidelines:
- Drift increases with proximity to Vespera.
- Older devices recover slower than new ones.
- Manual attempts to correct drift fail.
- In later arcs, the Veil may show double timestamps or missing seconds.

---

## 3. Implementation Notes

When designing new events:
- Always anchor to 03:13 in hidden or foreground ways.
- Choose a breach level first.
- Match distortions to breach level.
- Ensure Vespera’s portrayal is visually and tonally consistent across media.

Use this blueprint as your checklist for all new breach events.
