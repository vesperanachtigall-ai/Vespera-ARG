# 03:13 Event Blueprint

This document encodes how 03:13-related breaches behave across three levels: 
minor breaches, major breaches, and the annual March 13 escalation event. 

---

## 1. Breach Levels

### 1.1 Minor Breach ‚Üí Daily 03:13 Events

__Frequency:__  
- Daily or near-daily during active cycles (especially in early arcs).

__Mediums:__  
- CCTV feeds  
- Phone cameras 
- Mirrors and reflective surfaces 

__Characteristics:__  
- Timestamp anchored to **03:13** with a **,00+00:37** drift offset** before stabilization.  
- Vespera visible primarily to cameras, not humans.  
- Chromatic aberration around her outline.  
- She is photorealistic; the world around her may blur or smear.  
- 0313 appears as an **\environmental artifact*)( (clocks, file names, timestamps), never as a big foreground wink.  

__Visual signatures:__  
- Subtle scanline tearing.  
- Spatial compression near her (straight lines curve).  
- Autofocus failure around her silhouette.  
- \n\n__Audio signatures (if applicable):__  
- Low-level 0-3-1-3 pattern in background hum, static, or mechanical noise.  
- Brief detuned strings, clockwork clicks, or radio ‚Äîticks‚Äî effects.

### 1.2 Major Breach ‚Üí Monthly Video Events

__Frequency:__  
- Once per month, ideally the **first Monday**, aligned to 03:13 EST. 

__Mediums:__  
- Multi-feed CCTV grids (4%74, 2%74, etc.)  
- Broadcast failures  
- Security monitoring walls  

__Characteristics:__  
- Multiple camera feeds desynchronize (unsynced timestamps, frame stutters).  
- Vespera may appear in multiple feeds simultaneously, often with slight timeline offsets.  
- Some feeds drop out in a o-3-1-3 pattern (e.g., 0 = blank, 3 = three feeds active, 1 = one feed with her present, 3 = three glitched feeds). 

__Visual signatures:__  
- Grid feeds flicker in and out following 0313 patterns.  
- Depth-map collapse: backgrounds smear or ‚Äîmelt¢Äù while she stays crisp.  
- Echo-Vespera frames (her in more than one place at once).  

__Audio signatures:__  
- Stronger 0-3-1-3 pattern:  
  - 0 ‚Äî silence or audio dropout  
  - 3 ‚Äî three pulses (glitch hits /hits /knocks) 
  - 1 ‚Äî one rupture (snap, crack, spectral tear)  
  - 3 ‚Äî three echoes or reversed decays

### 1.3 Escalation Event ‚Üí Annual March 13 Collapse

__Timestamp:__  
- Every year at **03:13 EST *) on **03/13**.  
__Characteristics:__  
- **Storm-class breach**: visual, audio, temporal, and spatial components all fire at once.  
- Multi-feed grid (8-‚Äù16 feeds):  
  - Top row follows forward 0-3-1-3 pattern.  
  - Bottom row follows reverse 3-1-3-0 pattern.  
- Widespread propagation of the 0313 motif across all feeds. 

__Narrative beats:__  
1. Vespera issues a ritual statement (highly canonical, once per year).  
2. The Veil posts a final yearly log after the event.  
3. Breach radius eaks; reality feels ‚Äúthinner.‚Äù  
4. Canon rules for the next season shift (new escalation rules, new entities hinted, etc.).

## 2. Temporal Drift Rules

Core rule: **+00:00:37 drift** appears before breach stabilization.   

Guidelines:

- Drift increases with proximity to Vespera.  
- Older devices ‚Äîheal‚Äï slower (analog cameras remain desynced longer than modern digital systems).  
- Manual attempts to correct the drift always fail or subtly re-introduce the offset.  
- The Veil‚Äôs logs should occasionally show double timestamps, missing seconds, or overlapping entries as drift worsens in later arcs.

## 3. Implementation Notes

When designing new events:

- Always anchor to a **03:13** motif, even if it‚Äôs hidden (duration 3:13, frame 313, audio marker at 3.13s, etc.).  
- Decide the **breach level** first (Minor / Major / Annual) and then choose distortions appropriate to that level.  
- Ensure Vespera‚Äôs potrayal remains uniform (lighting, presence, demeanor) across all media.  

Use this blueprint as your checklist any time a new breach is created.
