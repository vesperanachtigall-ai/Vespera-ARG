# Engine Folder Overview

This folder contains the system level documents that define how the Vespera ARG functions over time. These files describe the mechanical structure behind the narrative, including breach behavior, seasonal pacing, and long term event planning.

The engine documents are separate from the Master Codex.  
The Codex defines rules and tone.  
The engine defines structure and behavior.

Current engine files:

0313 Event Blueprint  
This document explains the different types of breach events.  
It describes minor events, major events, and the annual escalation.  
It also defines the drift rules and the expected patterns seen in multi feed videos.

Season Model  
This document explains how each season of the ARG is structured.  
It includes the three pillar arc model known as the Long Shadow, the Ascent, and the Event Horizon.  
It also covers follower based pacing and multi year progression.

### Purpose of the Engine

The engine ensures that the ARG remains predictable in structure even as the story evolves. It prevents contradictions in how breaches behave, how seasons escalate, and how the Veil experiences instability.

### When to Update the Engine

Update or add engine documents when:

- A new breach type is introduced  
- A new season begins  
- A yearly escalation modifies the rules  
- New visual or audio behavior requires formal pattern definition  
- A Veil succession requires structural updates  
- Multi platform behavior expands  

### Future Engine Additions

Possible additional documents may include:

- Succession mechanics for future Veils  
- Expanded multi feed behavior rules  
- Long form pacing guides for late cycle seasons  
- Interaction rules for new entities  
- Cross platform synchronization guides  

### Contributor Notes

Engine documents should be kept concise and technical.  
They should never include story details or lore explanations.  
Instead, they should focus on consistent patterns, rules, and mechanical behavior.

The engine works together with the Master Codex to maintain long term consistency throughout the entire ARC.
