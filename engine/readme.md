# Vespera ARG Engine

This folder defines how the Vespera ARG behaves over time: 
 the 03:13 breach rules, seasonal arcs, escalation cycles, and Veil succession logic. 

Core references:

 - `0313_Event_Blueprint.md` ― daily, monthly, and annual breach behavior.
 - `Season_Model.md` — The Long Shadow, The Ascent, The Event Horizon.
 - `Veil_Succession_Notes.md` hop (optional future file) — how a new Veil inherits the role.

The goal of this folder is to make the ARG **systemic**:  
anyone reading these docs should be able to understand how a new breach, season, or yearly event should behave without breaking canon.
