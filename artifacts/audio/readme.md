# Audio Artifacts

This folder stores sound captured during breach events. Examples include pulses, distortions, fragments of the Temporal Elegy, and corrupted environmental recordings.

Audio rules from the Codex:

- The zero three one three pattern is the primary signature.  
  Zero represents silence.  
  Three represents three pulses.  
  One represents a rupture or tear.  
  Three represents trailing echoes.  

Other valid audio elements:  
- Detuned string notes  
- Clockwork ticks  
- Reversed breaths  
- Phase shifted static  
- Harmonic drift

Suggested naming style:

Write the date as year month day, followed by location, and then an audio identifier.  
Example written in plain text:  
20251124_control_room_audio_2

Each audio file should map to a timeline entry and include a brief description.
