# Video Artifacts

This folder holds videos associated with breach events. These may include surveillance footage, grid events with multiple camera angles, dashcam videos, or handheld recordings.

Video rules from the Codex:

- Visual distortions must occur before audio distortions.  
- Audio distortions must occur before any textual anomalies.  
- Grid events may follow the zero three one three pattern or reverse patterns depending on the row.  
- Device timestamps should show the drift of thirty seven seconds before stabilizing.  
- At lower escalation levels, Vespera may appear only inside screens or reflections.

Suggested naming style for video artifacts:

Write the date as year month day, followed by location, followed by a camera label, and then an event number.  
Example written in plain text:  
20251124_subway_cam_twelve_event_3

Every video should connect to a timeline entry and include notes about visible distortions.
