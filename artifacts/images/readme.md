# Image Artifacts

This folder contains still images recovered from breach events. Examples include corridor stills, composite frames, surveillance camera captures, and environmental images.

Image rules based on the Master Codex:

- Vespera must appear photorealistic.  
- Lighting around her should resemble cold Victorian illumination.  
- Her silhouette may show faint chromatic bending.  
- Backgrounds may blur or warp while she remains stable.  
- Spatial compression may occur near her presence.  
- The number sequence zero three one three should appear subtly in the environment.

Suggested naming style for image artifacts:

Write the date as year month day, followed by location, followed by a camera label, followed by a frame label.  
Example written in plain text:  
20251133_st_louis_cam_4_frame_313

Each image must relate to a timeline entry.
