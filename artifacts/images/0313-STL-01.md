# Artifact: 0313-STL-01  
St. Louis Corridor Breach — CAM-04 NORTH  
Captured: 2025-11-26 02:13:37 CST  
Drift: +00:00:37 (unresolved)

---

## Overview  
A corrupted frame recovered from CAM-04 NORTH inside a midtown office corridor in St. Louis, Missouri.  
The image depicts a distant silhouette standing at the far end of a blue-lit hallway.  
Spatial compression is visible along the east-facing wall, and overhead lighting bends inward toward the figure.  
The subject appears stable while the surrounding environment displays asymmetric blur.

No personnel on shift reported seeing any anomalies at the time of capture.

## Technical Details  
**Camera:** CAM-04 NORTH  
**Location:** Midtown Office Corridor, St. Louis, MO  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-26 02:13:37 CST  
**System Drift:** +00:00:37 (unresolved)

---

## Observed Distortions  
- Spatiotemporal compression along corridor wall  
- Chromatic fringing around distant figure  
- Environmental motion blur; figure remains sharp  
- Persistent timestamp drift  
- Partial frame corruption  
- Light-bend toward the subject

---

## Classification  
**Early Post-Manifestation Residue**

This event aligns with patterns documented in previous breaches occurring at or near 03:13 local time.  
The silhouette’s stability, combined with spatial compression and unresolved drift, matches early-stage post-manifestation signatures.

## Notes  
Additional corrupted frames from this sequence may be extracted and added at a later time.  
This is the first confirmed clear-frame silhouette from the St. Louis breach cluster.
