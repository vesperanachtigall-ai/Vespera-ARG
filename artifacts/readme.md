# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains all recovered media produced during breach events. Each artifact must be linked to a corresponding entry in the `timeline` folder and follow the visual and audio language rules defined in the Master Codex.

Artifacts are grouped into the following categories:

- images/  
  Still images, CCTV captures, composite frames, and breach photographs.

- video/  
  Footage from surveillance cameras, multi-feed grid events, and handheld recordings.

- audio/  
  0-3-1-3 pattern captures, Temporal Elegy fragments, and anomalous sound recordings.

- transcripts/  
  Veil missives, logbook entries, dialog transcripts, decoded messages, and associated text artifacts.

All artifacts should:
- Include a date in YYYYMMDD format.
- Use consistent naming and metadata.
- Be referenced by at least one timeline entry.
- Follow breach physics and Codex-defined distortion rules.
