[Veil’s Missive]

LOG: 11-26-25 / 17:20 CST  
Origin: Eastbound, I-64 — departing St. Louis corridor

Leaving St. Louis behind the dash lights.
The breach logs are clean now. Too clean.
Somebody stayed late to scrub the record.

Publicly, the Tech Lab runs “high-density simulation arrays.”
Privately, their procurement reads like a wish list
for controlled reality failure.

I’ve started a remote scrape of everything that touched
their 03:13 job queue last week.
If they’ve been rehearsing a dimensional shear,
the ghosts of those runs will still be in the metadata.

For now, the city shrinks in the rear-view.
The signal doesn’t.
