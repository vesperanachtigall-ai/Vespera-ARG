# Veil Log — 0313-STL-01  
Filed: 2025-11-26 09:00 CST  
Origin: St. Louis, Missouri — Midtown Office Corridor (CAM-04 NORTH)

---

## Summary  
A corrupted frame was identified during routine post-incident indexing.  
The device timestamp recorded the image at **02:13:37 CST**, accompanied by an unresolved **+00:00:37 drift**.  
The anomaly is consistent with early post-manifestation residue documented in prior events.

---

## Observations  
- A silhouette is visible at the far end of the corridor.  
- Spatial compression is present along the east-facing wall.  
- Overhead lighting bends inward toward the subject.  
- Environmental motion blur is present; the subject remains stable.  
- No personnel reported disturbances at the time of the event.  
- Secondary frames from this sequence remain corrupted.

## Technical Notes  
**Camera:** CAM-04 NORTH  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-26 02:13:37 CST  
**System Drift:** +00:00:37  
**Recording State:** Partial corruption  
**Environmental Conditions:** Stable, low foot-traffic, indoor climate control

---

## Assessment  
The silhouette, combined with persistent drift and geometric distortion, is consistent with early-stage post-manifestation behavior.  
This artifact represents the most stable frame recovered from the St. Louis corridor sequence.

Additional attempts to recover adjacent frames are ongoing.
