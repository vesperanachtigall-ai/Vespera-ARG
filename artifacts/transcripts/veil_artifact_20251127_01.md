**Filed by:** Handler Brannigan  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-27 09:03 EST  
**Artifact Type:** Image  
**Artifact ID:** 03:13-27-01  
**Source Location:** Times Square — DOT Traffic Camera 12A (Southbound)  
**Related Event:** Manifestation Cycle 03:13

---

## Executive Summary
A corrupted frame surfaced during review of the 03:13 capture cycle. A static silhouette is visible near the northwest flag display. Localized distortion surrounds the subject; crowd movement shows no awareness. Timestamp drift recorded at +00:00:37 before system re-sync.

---

## Artifact Description
A single frame recovered from the DOT’s 12A southbound traffic feed. Subject appears motionless, scale inconsistent with the camera’s recorded focal parameters. Distortion geometry suggests a non-environmental occlusion event.

## Attached Media
- **File:** *artifact_0313-27-01.jpg*  
- **Format:** JPEG  
- **Properties:** 1080p surveillance frame  
- **Checksum:** CHK[LOG:INT:0313-B]: 7fb22c173860c88e7168b94e3d9fd900

## Anomalous Signatures
- Focal distortion inconsistent with lens curvature  
- Shadow geometry mismatch  
- Crowd flow unaffected by subject presence  
- Static silhouette with no limb resolution  
- 00:00:37 drift prior to resync

---

## 0313 Correlation
Frame aligns with the recurring 03:13 manifestation window. Distortion pattern matches previous New York and St. Louis cluster signatures.

---

## Technical Analysis
Subject does not scale to expected environmental anchoring points. No thermal bloom detected. No DOT or NYPD incident reports filed. System registered interference for 5.7 seconds prior to normalization.

---

## Risk Assessment
**Threat Level:** Moderate  
**Containment Priority:** Elevated  
**Field Impact:** High urban exposure, low civilian detection

---

## Recommended Protocol Actions
- Flag Times Square node as **Active**  
- Begin drift monitoring for next cycle  
- Cross-compare silhouette with previous 0313 formations  
- Forward checksum to Analytics for texture anomaly mapping
